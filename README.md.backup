## Purpose
Below we will walk through the process of creating and hosting a resume online through the use of Github Pages, Markdown, and Jekyll. In doing so, we will explore the utility of modern documentation as stated by Andrew Etter in his book [Modern Technical Writing][Etter's Book].

## Prerequisites
These instructions assume you have created/understood the following:
  
- A Github account (create an account [here][Github])
- A resume formatted in Markdown (Markdown syntax [here][MarkdownGuide], Resume guide [here][ResumeGuide])

## Instructions
### Setup the repository:
1. Log into your Github account and navigate to the home page (should be the default page after logging in).
2. Click on the **New** button in the top left of the screen to create a new repository
3. Name the repository _**username**_.github.io
	+ _**username**_ should match the name on your Github account.
4. Make your repository **Public**
	- The repository should be Public by default, but this is essential for ensuring your website is accessable.
5. Click _Add a README file_
	- A _README_ file allows other collaborators to know the purpose/function of the repository.
6. Click **Create Repository**

### Uploading our Resume:
1. Open your newly created repository
2. Click the _**Add File**_ button
3. Click the _**Upload Files**_ button
	- This will open a dialogue window to upload your resume.md file that you created before.
4. Click the _**Commit changes**_ button to submit your files

### Configuring your Site:
4. Rename your resume.md to index.md
	- This allows Github to recognize your resume
 as the root page for your website.
 	- If you go to https://_**username**_.github.io you should see your resume (after Github has a chance to build and deploy your changes).
5. Click the _**Commit changes**_ button again to update your file

### Formatting and Theme:
1. Click the _**Add File**_ button
2. Click the _**Create new file**_ button
	- This will open a web editor for our file
3. Name your file _**_config.yml**_
	- This file will specify the style and format of your site, this separates the design and content of your website.
4. In the file add the following lines:
	>remote-theme: _**creator/theme-name**_
	-	This is your theme for your website, Github in the background will import the style information from the specified theme.
	-	You can find a list of potential themes that are publicly available [here][ThemePages].
	-	Always make sure to give credit to the theme's creator in your README!
5. Click the _**Commit new file**_ button to save and push your file to the repository.
	- As before, after a short delay for Github to build and deploy your site again, going to https://_**username**_.github.io should show your newly formatted resume.

## FAQs
1. Why use Markdown instead of a Word Processor?
	- Markdown is a lightweight scriptable language that is designed to be compatible with the web. This provides increased flexibility and power over a traditional Word Processor such as Microsoft Word.
	
2. Why is my resume not showing up?
	- Github takes time to deploy your website after a new commit, from your repository page if you navigate to the _**Actions**_ tab you can see if there is an active process (orange) or a failed process (red) which could be causing the problems. See [here][Github Pages Troubleshooting] if your site is failing repeatedly.
