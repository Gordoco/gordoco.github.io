# README

## Purpose
Below we will walk through the process of creating and hosting a resume online through the use of Github Pages, Markdown, and Jekyll. In doing so, we will explore the utility of modern documentation as stated by Andrew Etter in his book [Modern Technical Writing][Etter's Book].

## Prerequisites
These instructions assume you have created/understood the following:
  
- A Github account (create an account [here][Github])
- A resume formatted in Markdown (Markdown syntax [here][MarkdownGuide], Resume guide [here][ResumeGuide])

## Instructions
### Setup the repository:
1. Log into your Github account and navigate to the home page (should be the default page after logging in).
2. Click on the **New** button in the top left of the screen to create a new repository
3. Name the repository _**username**_.github.io
	+ _**username**_ should match the name on your Github account.
4. Make your repository **Public**
	- The repository should be Public by default, but this is essential for ensuring your website is accessable.
5. Click _Add a README file_
	- A _README_ file allows other collaborators to know the purpose/function of the repository.
6. Click **Create Repository**

### Uploading our Resume:
1. Open your newly created repository
2. Click the _**Add File**_ button
3. Click the _**Upload Files**_ button
	- This will open a dialogue window to upload your resume.md file that you created before.
4. Click the _**Commit changes**_ button to submit your files

### Configuring your Site:
4. Rename your resume.md to index.md
	- This allows Github to recognize your resume as the root page for your website.
5. Click the _**Commit changes**_ button again to update your file

### Formatting and Theme:
